## Overview

**Project Title:**  
Stream & Chill – Music Web App

**Project Description:**  
This web-based application allows users to stream and enjoy royalty-free music in a simple, clean interface. The player features track titles, album artwork, and full control to play, pause, or switch between tracks. It is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, offering a lightweight and accessible way to explore media playback on the web.

**Project Goals:**

- Build a responsive, mobile-friendly music player
- Practice DOM manipulation and JavaScript audio control
- Implement basic playlist navigation (next, previous, auto-play on end)
- Reinforce fundamentals of UI/UX with modern HTML/CSS design
